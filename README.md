## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Database**: MySQL (works with PostgreSQL/SQLite too)
- **SQL Features Used**:
  - Joins
  - Group By & Having
  - CTEs
  - Window Functions
  - Subqueries

---

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/sql-layoffs-analysis.git
Import the layoffs.csv dataset into your SQL database.

Run the queries from scripts/01_data_cleaning.sql to clean the dataset.

Execute scripts/02_eda_queries.sql to explore insights.



---

## 🔹 Step 3: Dataset
- You can download the same **layoffs dataset** from the YouTube video description (Kaggle/CSV).  
- Place it inside the `data/` folder.

---

## 🔹 Step 4: SQL Scripts
- **01_data_cleaning.sql** → all the cleaning queries from the video.  
- **02_eda_queries.sql** → all the analysis queries (top companies, layoffs by year, industry trends, etc.).
